title: Hello and draft paper
---

Hello, world!

We invite you to read a **draft** document containing the analysis that has led to Project Octopus: *[Towards a Design Space for a Commons Provenance System](/pub/Project_Octopus_-_Towards_a_Design_Space_for_a_Commons_Provenance_System.pdf)*.

> In this paper we examine the demand for and attempts to provide provenance systems for the digital commons and the design space for a new provenance system. We find that direct attempts have a poor track record, particularly those conceptualized primarily as copyright registries. But much useful provenance information concerning the digital commons is provided as a side effect of hosting, developing, and curating works, particularly within mass collaboration communities. We also note that there is much provenance and use information concerning works in the digital commons on the web that is not aggregated as such anywhere. We conclude that a web observatory is a high potential design frame for a new provenance system powered by mass collaboration with growing assistance from machine analysis and bots. Such an observatory could provide the reliable provenance information, access to heretofore lacking metrics and discovery mechanisms for the digital commons, and provide a sound basis for adding features such as content-derived lookup, whitelists,
and registration.

Critique, encouragement, and other forms of feedback warmly welcomed!
